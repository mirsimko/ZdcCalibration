\title{ZDC voltages}

\maketitle

The voltages were calculated according to the formula
$$
G = aU^b
$$
where $G$ is a gain and $U$ stands for voltage. The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are 
extracted from the following document:\\
\url{https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/system/files/ZDC_Document_20101005.pdf}\\
and are equal to approximately
\begin{equation}
b=4.2\,, \qquad a=4.0\,.
\end{equation}

We take into account that the desired position of the single neutron peak is at 60 ADC values
and the desired ratio between the towers is 6:3:1. To calculate the desired voltages we use the
formula
\begin{equation}
U_{\text{result}} = U_\text{current}\left(\frac{G_\text{desired}}{G} 
\frac{R_\text{desired}}{R}\right)^{1/4.2}
\end{equation}



where $G$ is the current position of the neutron peak, $G_\text{desired}$ is the desired position
of the neutron peak (currently 60), $R_{desired}$ is the desired ratio between the gain of the ADC SUM
tower and the current tower, and $R$ is the current ratio.
The resulting voltages are in Table \ref{uncorected}. The position of the single
neutron peaks in this test
are shown in Figures \ref{eastPlot} and \ref{westPlot}.
The ratios between the towers with the resulting voltages from the test
are shown in Table \ref{corected}.
Subsequently, new high-voltage values are also calculated.

Channels where the voltage would exceed 3000 V in table \ref{corected} were set to 3000 V to
protect the PMTs. New single neutron peak as well as the double neutron peak were found and
plotted in Figures \ref{eastThird}
and \ref{westThird}. The position of the double neutron peak was set as twice the mean
of the siingle neutron peak.
The resulting voltages in the next iteration are in table \ref{thirdCalib}.
